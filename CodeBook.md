# Code book

The below is the code book (data dictionary) for the tidy output dataset generated by run_analysis.R.

*AUTHOR'S NOTE*: typically a code book includes not only the variables and their descriptions but also respective units of measurement. The dataset does not offer any information on specific units, except for this in the Readme file:

> Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

There is also mention of Hz as units of measurement in the features_info.txt file.

I'm not certain whether we can assume that to be the units of measurement, especially in the case of magnifications, or whether the normalization to [-1,1] means "no measurement units".

# Study design

From the author: this section appears to be required, according to the lecture and must contain a "thorough description of how
data was collected". As far as the collection of data, it was done by the creators of the input dataset (the University of Genoa).
A detailed description of the process is provided in the file titled "features_info.txt".
